											<h3>Mechanism of TDP-43 aggregation</h3>
											<p>FTLD is heterogenous neurodegeneratie disorder involving frontal and temporal lobes.Three major proteins like FUS, TAR DNA binding protein and TAU  are involved in this mechanism.Post synaptic formation by fus is a early disease marker of FTLD.FTLD shows stratial involvement of both efferent system components  and glutametargic inputs from cerebral cortics.The caudate nucleus is primarly associated with behqaviour abnormality and cognitive involvement in FTLD .It has cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of cleaved form of TDP 43 protein.It has two hypothesis gain of toxicity and loss of function.FTLD patients show upper and lower symptoms.</p>
